title: Data Dumping Links From My Previous "Blog"
---

After running my own blog software on heroku, I've ported over to a github hosted [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) instance. Early on it is nice.

While initially intended to be a blog, it became a place to store how to reminders and links. Now that [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) serves that purpose, perhaps this'll be more of a proper blog.

That said, here's a dump of all the stuff I saved from the old blog, for posterity's sake and to avoid some kind of heroku db export in the future

Startup Idea: MySellNumber.com

    8:25:48 AM Johnny Goodman: I had a start up idea last night. Know how there are security certs and BBB certs and stuff? Make an icon "IWouldSellForX"
    8:26:23 AM Johnny Goodman: mousing over it would show the ballpark sale price of the business along with key metrics based on what business type it was. Clicking through would give you a form where buyers could contact the business owner.
    8:26:41 AM Johnny Goodman: on Iwouldsellforx.com you could browse all businesses and what their owners would need to part with them
    8:26:46 AM Ben Dauphinee: I think there's something like that already, for web properties
    8:26:47 AM Johnny Goodman: a more broad flippa.com
    8:26:50 AM Ben Dauphinee: Or similar
    8:26:54 AM Johnny Goodman: flippa is "i'm selling now"
    8:27:01 AM Johnny Goodman: instead of "I'm not selling, but I would move for this price"
    8:27:08 AM Johnny Goodman: thisismynumber.com is a better descriptor
    8:27:12 AM Ben Dauphinee: Interesting idea
    8:27:27 AM Johnny Goodman: I like it because it is a true weekend project business
    8:27:34 AM Johnny Goodman: I could code it with a few months of weekends
    8:27:38 AM Johnny Goodman: where as landingpage.com, I could not
    8:27:49 AM Johnny Goodman: I am itchy to build something and push something to get in the game and learn
    8:28:01 AM Ben Dauphinee: You have your homepage
    8:28:25 AM Ben Dauphinee: That could be prettier
    8:28:27 AM Johnny Goodman: no, something real
    8:28:36 AM Ben Dauphinee: You don't think it's real?
    8:28:42 AM Ben Dauphinee: It's a good way to cut you teeth
    8:28:45 AM Johnny Goodman: "I'm offering this to you user, would you like to buy it?"
    8:28:52 AM Ben Dauphinee: Ah
    8:29:04 AM Johnny Goodman: or even "would you take your time to use it?"
    8:29:08 AM Ben Dauphinee: Forget buy. I'm offering this free thing, would you like to use it at all

Life Automation

I recently gave this feedback to bombfell in response to their customer survey:

I am not using bombfell to be fashionable. I'm using them to save time, be comfortable and generally passable fashion wise. Life is too short to fool with clothes, but I find I must.

Fortunately, our culture allows me to wear brown shoes, khaki pants and a dress shirt every day - so to win I need:

A source of new dress shirts, conservatively patterned, that fit and look pretty good.

"The rest of the clothes" which are an occasional pair of khakis and some manpacks.com stuff like undershirts and underwear. (got that handled).

A dry cleaner that'll pick up and deliver from my house (got that handled).

I'm using bombfell in hopes of solving 1 and removing myself completely from this loop. It is going ok, but the shirts I get tend to be kind of tight. Each shirt is a unique snow flake, so I just wear em anyway and carry on.

I also don't like the one a month thing. Coders like to batch. It is a pain to get misfitting clothes and send them back. I know, I know, how lazy can one be? Here's what I'd prefer:

Send me 12 shirts, I try them all on, pay for what I want and send back what I don't. Heck, send me 40. I can knock out this year and next in 30 minutes. A blue dress shirt isn't going out of style anytime soon.

Another thing you might do is ask people to photograph their favorite shirts/pants/whatever and send them in. If I did this, I think your shirt picker would get an idea of just how conservative and boring I am in terms of fashion. :-)

I have no idea who your target is or if your company is going in my direction, but I want to end by sharing some of the personal projects I'm working on:

Automate monthly business expenses. (done)

Automate clothing purchase and delivery. (in progress)

Automate healthy food delivery via whole foods. (in progress)

Automate restock of TP/laundry detergent/etc. (in progress)

The big picture is stop selling me clothes and start selling me life automation. Netflix doesn't sell DVDs. They sell "don't drive to blockbuster, still get what I want".

I'm not after a shirt I love when I use your service, I'm after easy.

I did not hear back...

Ham Radio License Advice

The licenses are issued in three levels...Technician, General and Extra. The Technician is the first license...you can't get a General license until you have a Technician license. You could sit for the Technician and then the General license on the same night if you wanted (then you'd only pay one test fee. Then again, you could get a Technician license and not go any further. That would just limit the number of bands you could transmit on. However, those bands would include most all local repeaters...so, you'd have alot of transmission options from the get-go.

[ARRL.org](http://www.arrl.org/getting-licensed)

The Technician test is 35 questions, multiple choice and I believe the cost was $15. Test is offered at many locations locally, but I took it at the Stafford HCC campus. The Stafford area ham radio group runs that test. I believe they offer the test the 2nd Tuesday of each month at 6:15pm.

Training guides: I purchased a Kindle e-book version of a training course. It was beneficial, but I realized later all of this data is freely available on the internet.

[Study Guides](http://www.kb6nu.com/tech-manual/)

[Questions and Answers](http://hamelmer.com/Assets/Docs/Tech/2010%20Element%202%20Compact%20QandA.pdf)

[Another useful link from University of Michigan](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~becher/test/tech.html#guide)

I read the book and studied the questions and answers. The questions on the link above are the exact questions you will see on the test. Morse code is no longer a requirement for a ham radio license.

title: Platform and Market Network Implications
---

I stumbled upon NFX.com's [Network Effects](https://www.nfx.com/tags/network-effects/), [Marketplaces](https://www.nfx.com/tags/marketplaces/) and [Network Effects Bible](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-bible/) in my search to understand just how far Amazon was likely to go, how they were able to do it and what it meant for the future strategy of our business. I'd read Bezos biographies, [Amazon shareholder letters](https://medium.com/@austenallred/every-amazon-shareholder-letter-as-downloadable-pdf-4eb2ae886018), early days Amazon tell alls and all the other usual suspects. None of it clicked for me until I was introduced formally to Market Networks and by extension Platforms. 

Since that early revelation, I've been trying to understand and internalize the Platform trend well enough adapt it to our niche, include it in our long term strategy and put it to work. Alternatively, I've tried to spot Platform opportunies that may be far bigger than our niche but inside our circle of competence to execute.  As Buffett says, we're not trying to do brilliant or complex things, we're trying to spot simple value and high jump "over a 1 foot bar".

[@GavinSBaker](https://twitter.com/GavinSBaker) was on an Invest Like The Best podcast and mentioned enjoying 
[Modern Monopolies](https://www.audible.com/pd/Modern-Monopolies-Audiobook/B075Y3FQRS). I did too as it blends and extends ["software is eating the world"](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) and [Zero to One](https://www.audible.com/pd/Zero-to-One-Audiobook/B00M27LBU2?qid=1588092168&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=5X0YM0ET0V7943DGTC88) in a clear and pratical way. 

Here are my take aways:

1. Traditional or Linear businesses control the means of production and supply line. Platform businesses control the means of connection. 

2. Niches with linear businesses tend to have many players. Platform businesses are typically a winner take all per niche.

3. A platform connects a consumer with one or more groups of producers through a core transaction which allows a task or work flow to be completed in a cheaper, faster or better way than was possible before. 

4. It is faster to start and grow a linear business than a platform business, but platform businesses which catch traction produce exponentially better returns. This is due to their network effects enabling themto aggregate and "take a cut" of huge markets with a very small asset base.  

5. Platforms compete against one another on the quality of their core transaction, which can be measured by their [CAC](https://neilpatel.com/blog/customer-acquisition-cost/). CAC is a proxy for things like strength of network for each group needed for the core transaction, customer experience with the core transaction, strength of word of mouth and marketing effectiveness. 

6. Where linear and platform businesses touch, linear businesses are commoditized by platforms as to the 
degree they can not generate direct customer access, they must compete on price, quality and speed to earn sales. 

7. You can mix and match linear and platform elements, marketplace and network effect elements and asset heavy and light components in your offering - but if you don't have a single core transaction you master and scale first before bolting on other components, you will fail.

## The State and Expected Trend of Platforms

There still exist entire sectors of the US economy which are not yet unified by a Platform. 

In the 1990s and 2000s companies like Ebay and Google dominated. Ebay has a strong and long term business, but is now being taken apart niche by niche by the likes of Etsy, Autotrader and [GOAT](https://www.goat.com/). Google has done better parlaying search into Andriod and an Office Suite, but Amazon is taking ecommerce and DuckDuckGo has taken their privacy concerned niche. Even Amazon's [Prime Wardrobe](https://www.amazon.com/learn-more-prime-wardrobe/b?ie=UTF8&node=16122413011) launch to counter StitchFix has falled flat. There is staying power in a laser focused platform niche. 

The 2010s were defined by the [FAANGs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fang-stocks-fb-amzn.asp). The 2020s will see many new platforms: either those who consolidate existing sectors or those who take a large niched chunk out of an existing platform. 





> When these two forces meet, what happens? There can be only one platform per market area but a bite of each can be eaten by a company smaller, faster and more focused. 

> It seems like the game for those of us on the outside is to find a market, platform it and bonus points for taking a chunk of an existing player with your superior laser focus on a single core transaction.

title: A Critique of Subscriptions in the Platform Age
---

What would happen if there was a platform on which multiple sellers bid for the right to fulfill your product subscription as it came due?

The platform's role would be to ensure you a safe and intuitive transaction at the guaranteed lowest market price just before shipment. Delivering this in a seamless and intuitive way would likely require a custom workflow per market niche. 

Instead of specializing in CPAPs, bike parts, running shoes or "everything" - why not just specialize in perfecting subscriptions themselves, niche by niche?

## Price 

In today's subscription landscape, the relationship between subscription seller and customer is 1:1. This is true of niche players like niche CPAP vendors, mass ecommerce retailers and everyone in between. 

Each 1:1 relationship has an inherent conflict of interest as on a long term basis the customer has to trust that they are getting the best price and over the same long term basis retailers seek to optimize the margin. Even Amazon has built their system in the [classic 1:1 style](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=15283820011) and opted for a 15% or 20% discount based on item type or prime status. 

Are you sure that your subscription items are not 30% cheaper somewhere else? How do you know? Why isn't this easy to figure out? 

In a healthy market, buyers and sellers exchange at a price by active choice. In the subscription market, customers warily make a choice they know to be opaque. If they switch to another brand's subscription, they'll experience the same challenges, so by and large they either churn or satisfice. 

This is interpreted as engagement or retention, but I don't beleive it is. 

Further, if the purpose of a subscription is convenience, then by implication customers shouldn't be need to be price shopping carefully - it should just work. But today it doesn't. 

## From Timing to Consumption

Subscriptions currently resend on a time period basis instead of a consumption basis. This is another source of customer dissonence as whatever period of time you choose means you are almost certain to have too much or too little of your items in stock when you want them. 

Companies like (Bottomless.com)[https://www.bottomless.com/] are using IoT to determine when the perfect time to resupply a subscription is (based on consumption need instead of timelines)[https://player.fm/series/invest-like-the-best/michael-mayer-pseudonymous-social-capital-and-bottomless-coffee-invest-like-the-best-ep124]. It is early days but subscriptions powered by machine learning to detect things like your vacation are headed this direction. 

## Subscription Types

DollarShaveClub is unlikely to have much churn to 50 cent shave club. 

Subscriptions who add curation, taste or art are equally unlikely to be under threat. 

However, the majority of subscriptions consist of a commodity consumable selling at a higher than market price. These are at disruption risk.

## Why Hasn't This Been Built?

The multiple on earnings a business can receive is higher if a material portion of their business is reoccuring and therefore predictible. 

Each individual business is incentivized to convert single purchase customers into repeat subscription customers. As Amazon drives margin out of traditional "add to cart" ecommerce the flight to the higher margins and multiples of implicitly opaque subscriptions makes sense. 

It also creates an latent, ecomm wide margin that has yet to be unlocked by a platform and as Mr. Bezos says "your margin is my opportunity". 

Every individual business is competing with other businesses in their niche to opt in and retain the largest number of subscription customers but they are fighting a linear fight in a platform world. 

## How Might This Be Built?

You would need a first core transaction in a niche whose customer journey you could design to perfection. You could probably strip down a basic Magento instance with plugin for this purpose. 

CPAP would be a great first niche as CPAP.com has the knowledge to design an amazing customer workflow and be the first supplier. 

* Suppliers. 1 or more suppliers of CPAP equipment willing to bid per subscriber or per product to increase their total sales. 
* Customers. Willing to sign up for a new website and configure their subscription in exchange for free returns and the lowest price. 
 
You would run PPC against it advertising the guaranteed lowest price per shipment or your money back. 

Once successful, you would want to get adjacent into other consumable healthcare products and then into non-healthcare consumables. 

You'd build a standard subscription template and then a custom work flow per deviating niche. 

The winning platform would be a niche subscription artist. They would cover the majority of business niches the fastest with a quality that lowers the CaC due to word of mouth driven by equal or better subscription opt in experiences per niche.

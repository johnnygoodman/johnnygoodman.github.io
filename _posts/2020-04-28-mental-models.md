## Gotta Catch Them All

I find that the people I most admire are those who make it their habit to collect and apply mental models to their domain.

People define mental models a bit differently but blending [Poor Charlie's Almanac](https://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/) and [The Great Mental Models](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Great-Mental-Models-Audiobook/B07P7XYQK1) will start you down the path. 

A few of my favorites:

* [Invert, always invert](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040474-invert-always-invert)
* [The Map Is Not The Territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/)

[@patrick_oshag](https://twitter.com/patrick_oshag), whose [Invest Like The Best Podcast](http://investorfieldguide.com/podcast/) is an excellent source of new perspectives and mental models, was asked what he looks in someone he's meeting for the first time and said:

> "maybe the best indiciator is what percent of what they say is something I've heard elsewhere. Lower the better." 

I think this is possible because the degree of difficulty in applying the right "recipe" of models to a given domain leads to insights which seem obvious to the speaker but interesting to the unfamiliar mental model collector. This leads into a trap of sorts, where people try to capture the wisdom of what is being said instead of working to understand the latticework of models used to generate the conclusion. I think this is why so many (myself included) listen to Warren Buffett but so few invest like him.  

While there seem to be universal mental models in the Ray Dalio ["another one of those"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/life-principle-59-use-principles-ray-dalio/) spirit, their application is local - per situation or market niche. You need to have a framework of models to apply and a set of historical data to apply it to. 

## Implications

That gets me thinking about markets and market opportunities. [Modern Monopolies](https://www.audible.com/pd/Modern-Monopolies-Audiobook/B075Y3FQRS) blends and extends ["software is eating the world"](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) and [Zero to One](https://www.audible.com/pd/Zero-to-One-Audiobook/B00M27LBU2?qid=1588092168&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=5X0YM0ET0V7943DGTC88) in a clear and pratical way which provides the start of a mental model to explain both FANGS and what is next:

1. Any market which would benefit from a platform will get one (and only one due to the nature of platforms)
2. Niche platforms will take chunks out of existing large platforms

Ebay is still well profitable and growing but so are Etsy, Autotrader and recently shoe exchange platforms. I search on DuckDuckGo instead of Google where ever possible. Market networks haven't put a hurt on Amazon yet but it could happen. 

When these two forces meet, what happens? There can be only one platform per market area but a bite of each can be eaten by a company smaller, faster and more focused. 

It seems like the game for those of us on the outside is to find a market, platform it and bonus points for taking a chunk of an existing player with your superior laser focus on a single core transaction.

title: Mental Model Collector
---

I find that the people I most admire are those who make it their habit to collect and apply mental models to their domain.

People define mental models a bit differently but blending [Poor Charlie's Almanac](https://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/) and [The Great Mental Models](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Great-Mental-Models-Audiobook/B07P7XYQK1) will start you down the path. 

Here are a few of my favorites:

* [Invert, Always Invert](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040474-invert-always-invert)
* [The Map Is Not The Territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/)

[@patrick_oshag](https://twitter.com/patrick_oshag), whose [Invest Like The Best Podcast](http://investorfieldguide.com/podcast/) is an excellent source of new perspectives and mental models, was asked what quality signals he looks in someone he's meeting for the first time and said:

> "maybe the best indiciator is what percent of what they say is something I've heard elsewhere. Lower the better." 

I think this is possible because the degree of difficulty in applying the right "recipe" of models to a given domain leads to insights which seem obvious to the speaker but interesting to the unfamiliar mental model collector. This leads to fresh and mind expanding conversations. It can also lead to a trap of sorts, where people try to capture the wisdom of what is being said instead of working to understand the latticework of models used to generate the conclusion. I think this is why so many (myself included) listen to Warren Buffett but so few invest like him.  

While there seem to be universal mental models in the Ray Dalio ["another one of those"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/life-principle-59-use-principles-ray-dalio/) spirit, their application is local - per situation or market niche. You need to have a framework of models to apply and a set of historical data to apply it to. This is where the rubber meets the road on setting strategy or making investment decisions. 

Mental models aren't fancy or innovative, they are the intellectual work you do and price you pay to make something that seems complex to most simple, low risk and high return for yourself or your organization. 

In the coming days and months I'll be "thinking in public" through this blog in an attempt to apply my early study of mental models to the Sleep Apnea business in our post-COVID world.

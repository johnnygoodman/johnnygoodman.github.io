"Just curious, Do you invest in crypto currency or believe itâ€™s gold 2.0" -PQ

## Bull Case

(1) A lot of smart people and a lot of money are searching for the first real world business use case for blockchain. The world sure seems to need an internet speed transparent ledger. 

(2) There's major FOMO institutional money pouring in (rumored to be ~95% of recent transation volume). Pair that with QE-infinity and demand side in failed states like Venezuela who act as a market and it seems like it'll only increase in value from here. 

(3) It continues to build toward network effect. Everyone has heard of BTC and many own a little. Apps are popping up allowing you to spend BTC via credit cards or take low interest loans on your BTC. 

## Bear Case 

(1) American's reserve currency status is the bedrock of their global dominance. China and BTC are two threats to that status. 

(2) Nationstates understand that they will be disrupted if they can't control the money supply. An open standard for transactions using the internet makes things more traceable but less corruptable/adjustable to need. Nationstates have the guns and their citizens are the ones working on blockchain. Seems like they're best play is to neuter it with regulation and pervert it to serve their interests. 

(3) The most advanced BTC wallets (eg. coinbase) look and function exactly like today's trading/banking platforms. Swapping dollars for BTC isn't what the protocol was designed to do. 

## Gold vs BTC

Say BTC is the standard reserve currency of the world and each one is worth $1M. 

Is gold still worth anything in that world? I think yes. Reasons:

(1) If BTC ends up being "just another currency" they we have a historical record of Gold maintaining value in parallel. 

(2) If BTC ends up being the reserve currency, then you add BTC to the Gold/Silver/Platinum value hedge which already exists, and perhaps each incumbent loses a bit of "share" to BTC but not enough to matter if you're in a world where you really need to use hard currency. 

(3) You can't wear BTC. You can't melt down BTC for special conductive properties. There's still some non-zero value bottom base on Gold's own network effects and historical momentum. 

## My Opinion

I've passed on avoiding BTC because of the tax hassle. Probably not a great reason. 

I think Ray Dalio's short and long term credit cycles are a good model of [how our global economy works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0). Using that model, we are in the late innings of a macro credit bubble. American is now too near the QE-infinity to pull out and there's no will of citizens to do so. We will borrow until we can't and then default. This is the largest economic trend and event of our life time and means that hard assets should be a part of your portfolio. 

However, there are hard assets like Real Estate and Gold which are more attractive to me. I think I'd rather bet on things like "people want a place to live" and "my wife wants X to symbolize our marriage" than "blockchain sure looks useful". 

Might I buy a BTC or two? Yeah. But in total portfolio allocation terms, I'm personally going to try to hit a single on this one and not a homerun.

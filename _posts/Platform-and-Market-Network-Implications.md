## Implications

That gets me thinking about markets and market opportunities. [Modern Monopolies](https://www.audible.com/pd/Modern-Monopolies-Audiobook/B075Y3FQRS) blends and extends ["software is eating the world"](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) and [Zero to One](https://www.audible.com/pd/Zero-to-One-Audiobook/B00M27LBU2?qid=1588092168&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=5X0YM0ET0V7943DGTC88) in a clear and pratical way which provides the start of a mental model to explain both FANGS and what is next:

1. Any market which would benefit from a platform will get one (and only one due to the nature of platforms)
2. Niche platforms will take chunks out of existing large platforms

Ebay is still well profitable and growing but so are Etsy, Autotrader and recently shoe exchange platforms. I search on DuckDuckGo instead of Google where ever possible. Market networks haven't put a hurt on Amazon yet but it could happen. 

When these two forces meet, what happens? There can be only one platform per market area but a bite of each can be eaten by a company smaller, faster and more focused. 

It seems like the game for those of us on the outside is to find a market, platform it and bonus points for taking a chunk of an existing player with your superior laser focus on a single core transaction.

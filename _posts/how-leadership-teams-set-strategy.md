title: Questioning Canon on How Leadership Teams Set Strategy
---

If our leadership team needed to get together every quarter and set an IT plan on behalf of our CTO or a Merchandising Plan on behalf of our CMO, we'd think that was crazy. IT and Merchandising are disciplines whose practitioners need a lot of domain specific skill and experience. It is no knock on us if we know HR, Accounting or Operations instead - it simply isn't our area. We can't learn everything do we specialize and rely on our teammates. That's what a team or tribe is and should be.

Yet when a leadership team gets together, they are supposed to do strategy together, as domain knowledge equals. What is strategy if done and practiced well? Is it a discipline like IT? If so, why are we all doing it as if it is a universal language that is well understood by all participants - or that could be given time constraints and specialization? Shouldn't we have an expert to specializes in Strategy as a discipline? Shouldn't that person collaborate with other team members to draw out the information and needs relevant to optimizing a company strategy? 

I think the CEO should be to Strategy as CTO to Tech or CMO to Merchant. One team in collaboration and specialization. I don't think Strategy is holy or mystical, it is nothing more than an adjustable macro road map. Now the quality of that map is infused with a mix of experience and intellectual work gained by reading, understanding and boiling down countless mental models and market data. Just like the quality of any other discipline.

A mutual respect for each discipline along with a desire to fulfill mission while living behaviors is what should unite the team.
